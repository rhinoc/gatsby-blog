This repo is the source code for [OuttaScope](https://outtascope.tech/) (powered by [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com/) + [Netlify](netlify.com)).

You can see the [Hello Wolrd](https://outtascope.tech/posts/hello-world/) page for the detailed style of blog posts.

I also wrote a blog post about how I rewrite my blog with Gatsby: [我用Gatsby重写了我的博客](https://outtascope.tech/posts/gatsby/).

```shell
npm install # install dependencies
gatsby develop # debug the blog at localhost:8000
gatsby build # build
```
